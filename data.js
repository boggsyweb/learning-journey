I had already been practicing HTML and CSS for a few months before coming into the program, so it was a fun opportunity to push myself a tiny bit and polish up some skills. The best part was looking for pictures of my new city so I could show it off to everyone. I added some hover transitions on some images to make things a little more interesting.",

JS is still coming very slowly to me, as I'll discuss in later projects, but it's not as impossible as I once feared. I did push myself a littl at the end and add buttons to remove the scores. I never did get the right font for the scores, though...ðŸ¤”",
